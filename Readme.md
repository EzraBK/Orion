Warning
#######

This is a Work In Progress!  There are no warrantees or Guarantees 
of any type that this code is useable for anything.  But I hope it is…

Note: Most of this code is developed by Basic Micro/Orion Robotics.  I only upload it here as a way to not lose any bug fixes or
the like that I may make.  You should always check first with their website/forums to get the latest and greatest.

Overview
########

Most of these sub-directories are updated versions of some of the Basic Micro/Orion Robotics libraries.  Those files under the Libraries branch of 
this github are ones that go into your Arduino Sketchbook libraries directory.  Other directories are test programs, that I may upload as I believe
they can be useful

Some of these directories are WIP, with code to run the Phoenix Code base on some of the Orion Robotics robots.  Once this is fully working, some
of these directories may be removed as the additional code is merged in to the Phoenix in Parts project.
